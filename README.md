## Project Overview
This project utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze the Student Lifestyle Dataset, uncovering how daily habits (sleep, study time, activities, social interactions) relate to academic performance and stress levels. We’ll build predictive models and personalized recommendation tools to help students optimize time management and support mental well-being.

## Dataset Information
- **Name:** Student Lifestyle Dataset  
- **Records:** 2,000 students’ daily routines and stress metrics  
- **Source:** [Student Lifestyle Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/steve1215rogg/student-lifestyle-dataset/data)

## Potential Applications
- Forecast academic success based on lifestyle patterns  
- Provide AI-driven, individualized habit recommendations  
- Offer educators insights for schedule and extracurricular planning  

## Approach

1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**  
   - Normalize features, handle missing values, augment with external data  

2. **Machine Learning Techniques**  
   - Supervised (Regression & Classification)  
   - Unsupervised (Clustering for lifestyle segmentation)  
   - Time-Series Analysis (Habit sequence impact)

3. **Integration**  
   - Dashboard for habit tracking and real-time suggestions  
   - API integration with educational platforms  

## Deliverables
- Predictive models identifying key lifestyle factors  
- Recommendation engine for optimal daily habits  
- Interactive tool or mobile app for student self-monitoring
